        <h2> Our Purpose </h2>
        <h3> Creating Community</h3>
        <p> Our thought in creating this website was to create a stronger sense of community. We purposefully 
            chose to create this through digital means as many can argue that the internet has ruined our sense 
            of community. Computers, along with the rise of technology, have impacted society and changed the way 
            we interact with each other forever and, in many ways, has made us more anti-social. We were trying to 
            explore ways of making a space where people of a certain community could interact with each other and 
            help each other thrive. More specifically, we want to explore ways that the internet can help solve 
            immediate problems on a local scale, like Stevens or any University.</p>
        <h3> Promoting Inclusivity</h3>
        <p> We created a website in which users can create "complaints" and post their concerns publicly to their 
            community's dashboard without fear of penalty. In our personal experience, if there is a problem around 
            campus, it's difficult as a single person to amplify one's voice, especially if the problem affects a 
            select few or an underrepresented group. More often than not, when an issue it brought up, it typically 
            takes a few weeks to months for it to be addressed as it's only 'one' person's complaint. However, we 
            are hoping that, in creating this anonymous site, every individual will feel more comfortable speaking 
            their mind in a post, especially with "bigger picture" problems that need more immediate effect (cough 
            cough the Burchard building's bathroom situation). So, by having an online outlet where many people can 
            easily discuss and show their support through likes and messages, we are hoping that it opens the door 
            to a more inclusive campus and safe space for everyone. </p>
        <h3> Overall Goal</h3>
        <p> This would ideally make matters that currently have trouble getting any traction more pressing to the 
            administrators that need to oversee that change as it is more publicized. We will look into flaws in 
            other sites that could have that potential, and we will also look into the stigmas of how people react 
            to change and what goes into making an idea come to fruition. </p>
